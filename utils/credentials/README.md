This folder should contain credential files (e.g. provided by Google):

1. Firebase files (if this app uses Firebase Cloud Messaging and Firebase Crashlytics atm):
   - `google-services.json` for android
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS

2. Google service account key file for Expo EAS to be able to submit apps to the Play Store:
   - `google-play-service-key.json`
